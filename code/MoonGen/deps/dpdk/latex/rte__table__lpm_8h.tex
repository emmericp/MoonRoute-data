\subsection{Detailed Description}
R\+T\+E Table L\+P\+M for I\+Pv4

This table uses the Longest Prefix Match (L\+P\+M) algorithm to uniquely associate data to lookup keys.

Use-\/case\+: I\+P routing table. Routes that are added to the table associate a next hop to an I\+P prefix. The I\+P prefix is specified as I\+P address and depth and cover for a multitude of lookup keys (i.\+e. destination I\+P addresses) that all share the same data (i.\+e. next hop). The next hop information typically contains the output interface I\+D, the I\+P address of the next hop station (which is part of the same I\+P network the output interface is connected to) and other flags and counters.

The L\+P\+M primitive only allows associating an 8-\/bit number (next hop I\+D) to an I\+P prefix, while a routing table can potentially contain thousands of routes or even more. This means that the same next hop I\+D (and next hop information) has to be shared by multiple routes, which makes sense, as multiple remote networks could be reached through the same next hop. Therefore, when a route is added or updated, the L\+P\+M table has to check whether the same next hop is already in use before using a new next hop I\+D for this route.

The comparison between different next hops is done for the first “entry\+\_\+unique\+\_\+size” bytes of the next hop information (configurable parameter), which have to uniquely identify the next hop, therefore the user has to carefully manage the format of the L\+P\+M table entry (i.\+e. the next hop information) so that any next hop data that changes value during run-\/time (e.\+g. counters) is placed outside of this area.
