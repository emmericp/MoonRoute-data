This folder contains benchmarking and analysis scripts, which were executed
on testbed servers.
They are thought to be a starting point for similar benchmarks.

These scripts rely on an internal communication framework through commands
starting with "testbed-". The only part of the framework we use here is
a sync feature to time starting the packet generator and MoonRoute.
testbed-sync effectively takes an ID and waits until both servers execute it
before continuing. This needs to be replaced by something that does the same
(can be as simple as ssh'ing to the other server)

NOTE: the scripts are not neccessarily in the state, as they were executed
for performing the benchmarks, as seen in the paper or master thesis.
This is because the scripts include configuration variables, e.g. the tested ranges
that might need to be adapted.

To rerun any test, carefully read the description and the script and
adjust the configuration to match the description.
